### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a C++/Python developer and open-source enthusiast. For the last few years, I've worked as a lead developer or/and product manager, but I'm still deep in coding. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ReductStore](https://reduct.store). This is a time series database for big blobs (sound, pictures, models) which may be useful for AI/ML applications. As an employee at [PANDA GmbH](https://panda.technology) I'm developing an C++/Python open-source library [WaveletBuffer](https://github.com/panda-official/WaveletBuffer) for data compression.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++20, technologies like K8S, S3, Grafana, InfluxDB. Mostly I learn what I need for my current projects. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborating on [ReductStore](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore) and ecosystem around it (guides, SDKs in different languages, CLI, and web consoles). I'd appreciate any help.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, Python, bind11, wavelet transformation, Industry 4.0 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can find my Tweeter and LinkedIn in my GitHub profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
