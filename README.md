### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Rust/C++/Python developer and open source enthusiast. For the last few years I've been working as a lead developer and/or product manager, but I'm still deeply involved in coding.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ReductStore](https://reduct.store). This is a time series database for storing and managing large amounts of blob data.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborating on [ReductStore](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore) and ecosystem around it (guides, SDKs in different languages, CLI, and web consoles). I'd appreciate any help.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Rust, C++, Python, bind11, wavelet transformation, Industry 4.0 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can find my Tweeter and LinkedIn in my GitHub profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
